🧮 Calculator Project

This is a console-based calculator written in Python.  
It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and supports chained calculations, meaning the result of one operation can be used directly in the next calculation.


📂 Project Structure

- __init__.py: Contains the complete logic for:
    - Taking user input for numbers and operations.
    - Performing the selected mathematical operation.
    - Allowing the user to continue calculations with the previous result or start fresh.
    - Displaying results in real time.


📝 Features

- ✅ Supports basic operations:
    - Addition (+)
    - Subtraction (-)
    - Multiplication (*)
    - Division (/)
- ✅ Displays intermediate results after each operation.
- ✅ Allows chaining calculations — the user can keep using the result for new operations.
- ✅ Option to start over or quit after each calculation.
- ✅ Simple and intuitive interface.
